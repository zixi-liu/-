#### Intro

When we don’t have the language to talk about what we’re experiencing, our ability
to make sense of what’s happening and share it with others is
severely limited.

Our ability to accurately recognize and label emotions is often
referred to as **emotional granularity**.

In fact, research shows that the process of labeling emotional
experience is related to greater **emotion regulation** and
psychosocial well-being.

#### Places We Go When Things Are Uncertain or Too Much

**Stressed and Overwhelmed**

- Our emotional reaction is
more tied to our cognitive assessment of whether we can cope
with the situation than to how our body is reacting.
  - My emotions are responding to my “thinking” assessment of how well I can handle something.

- It’s all unfolding faster than my
nervous system and psyche can manage it.
- Mindful play, or noagenda, non-doing time, is the cure for overwhelm.
- The non-doing also makes sense—there is a body of research
that indicates that we don’t process other emotional
information accurately when we feel overwhelmed, and this
can result in poor decision making.

**Anxiety**

- Let. Me. Off. The. Boat.

- Anxiety can be both a state and a trait.
- An intolerance for uncertainty is an important contributing
factor to all types of anxiety.
- Our anxiety often leads to one of two coping mechanisms:
worry or avoidance.
  - The Dance of Fear
- Anxiety <> Excitement
- Fear arises when we need to respond quickly to physical or
psychological danger that is present and imminent.

**Vulnerability**

#### Places We Go When We Compare

- Comparison is the crush of conformity from one side and
competition from the other—it’s trying to simultaneously
fit in and stand out.
- Regardless of the different outcomes, in the end,
comparing ourselves to others leads us to fear, anger, shame,
and sadness.
- Unlocking Us / Stretch
- The good news is that we get to choose how we’re going to let
it affect us.
  - My new strategy is to look at
the person in the lane next to me, and say to myself, as if I’m
talking to them, Have a great swim.

**Admiration and Reverence**
