### 10.1.1 Digital versus analog
In a typical situation a microprocessor or computer might monitor signals from
an experiment or industrial process, control the experimental parameters on the basis of the data obtained, and store
for future use the results collected or computed while the
experiment is running.

Because of the wide availability
of inexpensive (less than $1) microcontrollers, such applications are ubiquitous. The average home is awash in devices with “embedded” processors: in every music player,
television set, cellphone, dishwasher, washing machine and
dryer, fax, copier, microwave oven, coffee maker,. . . .
