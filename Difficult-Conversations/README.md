## Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most 

### The "What Happened" Question

- what keep them from seeing it coming
- how to prevent the problem from happening again

- "How could you do such a thing?"
- "And" helps you to be curious and clear

#### Disentangle Intent from Impact
- Assumptions about intentions are often wrong
   - we make an attribution about another person's intentions based on the impact of their actions on us.
- Accusing bad intentions creates defensiveness
- Attributions can become self-fulfilling
- We don't hear what they're really trying to say: A literal focus on intentions end up clouding the conversation.
- We ignore the complexity of human motivations
- Share the impact on you; Inquire about their intentions.
- Listen for feelings, and reflect on your intentions.
